## Overview and Origin:
* FinTech Domain: Payments/Billing
* Venmo was launched in 2009 by Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. The pair met while attending college at the University of Pennsylvannia in 2001. After spending several years bouncing around different startups the two friends/roommates decided to launch Venmo in 2009. The idea originally started out as "a music startup that allowed people to send a text to a band to have an mp3 show up in their email." The pair came up with the name "Venmo" by combining the latin word vendere, which means "to sell", and "mo" for mobile. Eventually the concept of Venmo transformed into a payment service app available to anyone for anything, not just musicians. This came to be after Magdon-Ismail traveled to NYC to visit Kortina one weekend and realized he'd left his wallet back in Phillidelphia causing Kortina to have to cover him for the entire weekend. At the end of the visit Magon-Ismail wrote Kortina a check. It was this moment the two friends realized how ridiculous it was to be writing a check in a time where it felt you could do almost everything else with your phone. So they decided to solve the problem.
* About a year after launching Venmo, Magdon-Ismail and Kortina were able to raise $1.2 million in seed money thanks to a friend's father. About two years after that their company was acquired by Braintree, a fintech payments company, who in turn was acquired by PayPal in 2013 for $800 million. 
* Currently Venmo is mostly funded through transaction fees. The company collects a 3% transaction fee from those using a credit card to make payments or if you are a business account the app charges a 2.9% fee when consumers use the app to pay. 


## Business Activities:
* Venmo has been able to help solve old school, slow method ways of paying by offering a quick and easy way to instantly transfer funds electronically from one party to another. 
* Venmo's intended customer base has been the millennial generation. "It's convenience and accessibility makes it perfect for Millennials and younger generations who want to make casual transactions, like paying back a friend for lunch or a ride."
* In 2019 PayPayl revealed that Venmo had more than 40 million users - making them the most popular payment service app out there. Venmo currently doesn't charge it's users to send or receive money (unless using a credit card), unlike the rest of the P2P apss that are currently out there. 
* Venmo, like other P2P apps uses blockchain technoogy. "Mobile payments is one of the most popular uses of blockchain technology so far because the decentralized nature of blockchains - the technology's most differentiating feature - provides a nearly unbreakable layer of protection around every transaction."

## Landscape:

* Venmo falls within the largeset domain of the FinTech industry, Payments and Billing. 
* Mobile payment apps have not only been the largest but fasetest growing segment of the FinTech space. 
* Large companies like Google and Apple have started to roll out new features such as facial recognition and fingerprinting to release payments as well as the newesst innovation, Biometric Authentication, which is a verification method that involves biological and structural characterisitics of a persion. This can include everything from facial recognition to heartbeat analysis to even vein mapping. 
* Other major companies withihn the P2P app world include Square Payments, Sage Payment Solutions, Stripe, PayPayl (Venmo's parent company), Zelle, ApplePay, Android pay, and Cryptocurrencies. 

## Results:

* Since its launch Venmo has made a huge imapct on our economy, especially within the younger generations by replacing cash and checks. Some would even say Venmo has essentially turned us into a "Cashless Economy". It has completely transformed the way millennials make financial decisions. 
* Venmo and other payment service apps are able to measure their success by calculating the number of users they have as well as the payment volume they do. Right now, Venmo is one of the leading companies in the P2P app department.
